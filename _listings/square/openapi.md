    post:
      summary: BatchDeleteCatalogObjects
      description: |-
        Deletes a set of [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem)s based on the
        provided list of target IDs and returns a set of successfully deleted IDs in
        the response. Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of the
        targeted object are also deleted. For example, deleting a CatalogItem will
        also delete all of its [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation)
        children.

        `BatchDeleteCatalogObjects` succeeds even if only a portion of the targeted
        IDs can be deleted. The response will only include IDs that were
        actually deleted.

      description: |-
        Returns a set of objects based on the provided ID.
        Each [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem) returned in the set includes all of its
        child information including: all of its
        [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) objects, references to
        its [CatalogModifierList](#type-catalogmodifierlist) objects, and the ids of
        any [CatalogTax](#type-catalogtax) objects that apply to it.

  /v2/catalog/batch-upsert:
    post:
      summary: BatchUpsertCatalogObjects
      description: |-
        Creates or updates up to 10,000 target objects based on the provided
        list of objects. The target objects are grouped into batches and each batch is
        inserted/updated in an all-or-nothing manner. If an object within a batch is
        malformed in some way, or violates a database constraint, the entire batch
        containing that item will be disregarded. However, other batches in the same
        request may still succeed. Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects, and
        batches will be processed in order as long as the total object count for the
        request (items, variations, modifier lists, discounts, and taxes) is no more
        than 10,000.
