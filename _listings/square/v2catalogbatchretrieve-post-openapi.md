      summary: BatchDeleteCatalogObjects
      description: |-
        Deletes a set of [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem)s based on the
        provided list of target IDs and returns a set of successfully deleted IDs in
        the response. Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of the
        targeted object are also deleted. For example, deleting a CatalogItem will
        also delete all of its [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation)
        children.

        `BatchDeleteCatalogObjects` succeeds even if only a portion of the targeted
        IDs can be deleted. The response will only include IDs that were
        actually deleted.
